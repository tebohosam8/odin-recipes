    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <h4>This classic beef stew is the ultimate hearty and satisfying meal! It’s a cold-weather, one-pot wonder with chunks of beef chuck roast that are seared until golden, then simmered with vegetables and herbs in a rich and savory broth that’s complex
            in flavor but really simple to make. The whole family will love it! </h4>

    <h2>Beef Stew Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef Stew Meat:  </strong>Stew meat is typically beef chuck roast, which is a tender, marbled portion of the upper shoulder and lower neck. This means you’ll have a good amount of fat to keep the beef chunks juicy and tender as they cooks
            in the pot.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Flour:  </strong>A little bit of flour is added to thicken the broth. I’m using arrowroot powder today, but you could use cornstarch or another flour of your choice.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Dry Red Wine:  </strong>To give this stew a bold and rustic flavor, grab a bottle of cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. But there’s no need to buy an expensive wine, just one you typically like to drink since there will be leftovers!</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Beef Broth:  </strong>Use any low-sodium beef broth brand that you like.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Red Wine Vinegar and Tomato Paste:  </strong>Essential ingredients to give the broth depth of flavor. Plus, the tomato paste helps to thicken the sauce a smidge.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Aromatics:  </strong>Fresh garlic, dried thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper are all you need! In a pinch you could use garlic powder, but I do prefer fresh garlic in this recipe.</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<body>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Season the beef:  </strong>Pat the beef chunks dry with paper towels, then season with a good amount of salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sear the beef:  </strong>In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, place the beef in the pot and sear on all sides until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side, then remove to a plate.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Saute the onion:  </strong>Add the onion and garlic to the pot and pour in the vinegar (which will help to loosen browned bits from the bottom of the pot) and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the onion is softened. Add the tomato paste and
            cook for a minute more.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Return the beef to the pot:  </strong Add the seared beef back to the pot and sprinkle the flour on top. Stir everything together, until the flour is fully dissolved.></li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Add the liquids and aromatics:  </strong>Add the wine, broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Use a large spoon or spatula to stir everything together. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for 1
            hour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Add the veggies:  </strong>Add the potatoes, carrots, and celery. Cook for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are fork-tender. Remove the bay leaves, and if you’d like, garnish with fresh thyme before serving.</li>
