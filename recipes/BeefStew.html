    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <h4>This classic beef stew is the ultimate hearty and satisfying meal! It’s a cold-weather, one-pot wonder with chunks of beef chuck roast that are seared until golden, then simmered with vegetables and herbs in a rich and savory broth that’s complex
            in flavor but really simple to make. The whole family will love it! </h4>

    <h2>Beef Stew Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef Stew Meat:</strong>Stew meat is typically beef chuck roast, which is a tender, marbled portion of the upper shoulder and lower neck. This means you’ll have a good amount of fat to keep the beef chunks juicy and tender as they cooks
            in the pot.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>A little bit of flour is added to thicken the broth. I’m using arrowroot powder today, but you could use cornstarch or another flour of your choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Red Wine: </strong>To give this stew a bold and rustic flavor, grab a bottle of cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. But there’s no need to buy an expensive wine, just one you typically like to drink since there will be leftovers!</li>
        <li><strong>Beef Broth: </strong>Beef Broth: Use any low-sodium beef broth brand that you like. I’ve linked the one I always buy in the recipe card below.</li>
        <li><strong>Red Wine Vinegar and Tomato Paste: </strong>Essential ingredients to give the broth depth of flavor. Plus, the tomato paste helps to thicken the sauce a smidge.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics: </strong>Fresh garlic, dried thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper are all you need! In a pinch you could use garlic powder, but I do prefer fresh garlic in this recipe.</li>


    </ul>
