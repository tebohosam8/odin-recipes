# odin-recipes
The project is about creating a website of my own with 3 different recipes.
I had to describe what recipes i've picked is and give the instructions on how to make it.
I have learned about creating website, creating a link to another page that is where i had to give out the instruction on how to make those recipes and be able to add a picture of the recipes to give out the idea on how the recipe looks like once done. 
This project introduced me no the basic of HTML.
